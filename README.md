# Data Analysis Assistant - Streamlit App

## Overview

The **Data Analysis Assistant** is a powerful Streamlit-based application designed to assist with data exploration, visualization, and analysis. It utilizes Googleâ€™s Gemini AI model to provide insightful summaries, analysis plans, and visualizations based on user-uploaded CSV data. The app automates the process of generating charts, statistical summaries, and insights, making it an ideal tool for data analysts and business intelligence professionals looking to speed up their data exploration process.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Generates detailed analysis plans, final insights, and chart summaries using the Google Gemini model.
- **Data Visualization**: Automatically generates multiple visualizations including correlation heatmaps, pair plots, histograms, count plots, and box plots.
- **Interactive UI**: Simple and intuitive interface powered by Streamlit, allowing users to upload their CSV data and view results in real-time.
- **Data Summary**: Automatically summarizes the dataset, including its schema, preview, and missing values.
- **Chart Insights**: Uses AI to provide a concise summary of patterns, anomalies, or key takeaways from the generated charts.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PriyanshuDey23/EDA-Agent.git
cd data-analysis-assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

This application requires a valid **Google API Key** to work with the Gemini AI model. 

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project.
- Add your Google API key to the `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your_google_api_key>
```

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

After the environment is set up, start the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Upload Dataset

Upon running the application, you will see a simple interface with an option to upload your dataset in CSV format.

- Click **"Upload CSV"** and select the CSV file from your local machine.

### 2. AI-Powered Analysis

Once the dataset is uploaded, the app will automatically:

- Provide a **DataFrame Summary** including schema, preview, and missing values.
- Display an **Analysis Plan** generated by the AI model.
- Present **Final Insights** based on the dataset.
- Generate multiple **Visualizations** such as heatmaps, pair plots, histograms, and box plots.

### 3. Chart Insights

The app will analyze the charts generated and provide insights such as notable patterns, anomalies, or key takeaways, using the AI model.

### 4. Clean-Up

Once the analysis is complete, the application will automatically clean up any temporary files generated during the process.

## Functions

### `save_fig(fig)`

**Description**: Saves a Matplotlib figure to a temporary PNG file and returns the file path.

**Parameters**: 
- `fig`: A Matplotlib figure object.

**Returns**: 
- The path to the saved image file.

### `convert_df_to_string(df)`

**Description**: Converts a DataFrame into a markdown-like string for AI analysis. It includes schema, preview of the first few rows, and missing values information.

**Parameters**:
- `df`: A Pandas DataFrame.

**Returns**:
- A string summarizing the DataFrameâ€™s schema, preview, and missing values.

### `ai_text_analysis(prompt_type, df_str)`

**Description**: Generates an analysis plan or final insights based on a dataset description using the AI model.

**Parameters**:
- `prompt_type`: A string that specifies the type of analysis ("plan" or "final").
- `df_str`: A string representation of the dataset for AI processing.

**Returns**:
- A string with the AI-generated analysis or insights.

### `ai_chart_analysis(chart_summaries)`

**Description**: Analyzes chart summaries for insights, such as patterns, anomalies, or key takeaways, using the AI model.

**Parameters**:
- `chart_summaries`: A string summarizing the generated charts.

**Returns**:
- A string with the AI-generated chart insights.

### `generate_visuals(df)`

**Description**: Automatically generates a set of visualizations based on the uploaded dataset, including correlation heatmaps, pair plots, histograms, count plots, and box plots.

**Parameters**:
- `df`: A Pandas DataFrame.

**Returns**:
- A list of visualizations with their titles and file paths.
- A list of temporary file paths for image cleanup.

### `cleanup(files)`

**Description**: Cleans up any temporary image files generated during the analysis process.

**Parameters**:
- `files`: A list of file paths to be removed.

**Returns**:
- None.

## Technology Stack

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language for app development.
- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the interactive web UI.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For generating static, informative visualizations.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and processing.
- **Google Gemini AI**: To generate natural language insights, analysis plans, and chart interpretations.
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables securely.

## Sample Workflow

1. **Upload CSV**: User uploads a CSV file through the Streamlit interface.
2. **Data Summary**: The app automatically summarizes the dataset, providing a detailed description of its structure, preview, and any missing data.
3. **AI Analysis**: AI generates an analysis plan and provides a summary of key insights from the data.
4. **Visualizations**: The app generates and displays multiple charts, offering both numerical summaries and categorical insights.
5. **AI Chart Insights**: The app analyzes the generated charts and provides concise interpretations of the visual data.

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing API Key**: If the app throws an error regarding the missing Google API key, ensure that you have correctly set the environment variable in your `.env` file.
- **CSV Errors**: If the CSV is empty or malformed, the app will display an error message. Please verify the CSV structure before uploading.
